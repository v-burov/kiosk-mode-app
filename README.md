~# Kiosk Mode [Deprecated]~

~Current approach does not work on latest android versions. The app is no longer supported.~

~# Goal:~

~To force user to stay inside application.~
~To use the app manage overlay and home app permission should be granted.~

~- The app intercepts user actions such as button back, home button etc.~
~- The app tracks if the phone is rebooted and displays kiosk mode app as the first app.~
~- The app does not allow user to lock the phone and turn off display.~
